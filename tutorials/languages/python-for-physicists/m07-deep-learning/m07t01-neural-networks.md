# Neural Networks

> Doing it the brain's way!

The brain can be imagined as a framework acquiring information from the sense organs, processing it and coming up with a thought. 
On a microscopic level, this framework consists of pathways transfering electrical signals between nodes called neurons, which are connected to each other by edges and can be regarded as a network of activatable switches \[[1](#01)\].

Artificial neural networks were designed to mimic this biological workflow of the brain \[[2](#02)\]. 
In the last decade, such networks have proved to be quite useful (and popular) in classifying images \[[3](#03), [4](#04)\], in natural language processing \[[5](#05), [6](#06)\] as well as have displayed extra-ordinary results in certain competitive games \[[7](#07), [8](#08)\].

In the area of physical sciences, neural networks are currently being used to predict and understand various properties of materials \[[9](#09)\], detect and classify phases of matter \[[10](#10)\] as well as simulate trends of other quantum mechanical properties \[[11](#11)\].
