# Python for Physicists

> A complete tutorial series for programming in Python specifically aimed to suffice simulation and visualization requirements for physicists.

*Python* is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose language supporting object-oriented programming with more emphasis on code-readibility and extensibility. It has a wide range of applications ranging from scientific computing libraries like TensorFlow, to stand-alone applications like Blender.

This tutorial series gradually traverses from basic to advanced topics of Python for scientific computing purposes pertaining to the area of physical sciences. The tutorials and their corresponding notebooks are clubbed into different modules based on the topics covered.

## [Module 01 - Getting Started](https://github.com/Sampreet/gists/blob/master/tutorials/languages/python-for-physicists/m01-getting-started/)

This module primarily focuses on getting acquainted to Python's environment using Anaconda distribution and optionally using VSCode for editing and running scripts.
