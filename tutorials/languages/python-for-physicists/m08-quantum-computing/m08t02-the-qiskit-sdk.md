> Cloud Computing meets Quantum Computers!

*Qiskit* is an [open-source framework](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.256211) written in Python which provides access to quantum computing platforms for learning, as well as facilitates research on quantum computation. 
Together with the [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/), it can be used to work with quantum computers at a level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms.

## Installing the SDK

***Prerequisite: [Module 01 - Getting Started](../m01-getting-started/)***

The Qiskit Software Development Kit (SDK) requires a 64-bit version of Python 3.5 or later and preferably a virtual environment to avoid dependency clashes with other installed packages. Create a new Python environment for the latest version of Python 3.x via the following command:

```bash
conda create --name qcomp python=3 numpy
```

Next, update pip


***The [qiskit-tutorials repository](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials) contains an awesome collection of IPython notebooks.***
