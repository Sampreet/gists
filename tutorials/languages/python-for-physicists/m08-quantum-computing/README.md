# Quantum Computing

> Towards a new dawn!

[&#8592; \[Previous\] Module 07 - Deep Learning](../m07-deep-learning/)

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this module, make sure you brush up the following:

### Basic knowledge of Python

Since we will primarily be using the Qiskit SDK to execute our programs in the IBM Quantum Experience cloud, a preliminary knowledge of Python is a must! 
You must have Python [installed](../m01-getting-started/), with a overview of its [fundamentals](https://github.com/Sampreet/gists/blob/master/tutorials/languages/python-for-physicists/m02-fundamentals-of-python/), [visualization](https://github.com/Sampreet/gists/blob/master/tutorials/languages/python-for-physicists/m03-visualizing-data/) and [computing](https://github.com/Sampreet/gists/blob/master/tutorials/languages/python-for-physicists/m04-scientific-computing/) libraries.
