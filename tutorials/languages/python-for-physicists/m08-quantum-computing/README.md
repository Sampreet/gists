# Quantum Computing

> To a new beginning!

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this module, make sure you brush up the following:

### Basic knowledge of Python

Since we will primarily be using the Qiskit SDK to execute our programs in the IBM Quantum Experience cloud, a preliminary knowledge of Python is a must! You must have Python [installed](https://github.com/Sampreet/gists/blob/master/tutorials/languages/python-for-physicists/m01-getting-started/), with a overview of its [fundamentals](https://github.com/Sampreet/gists/blob/master/tutorials/languages/python-for-physicists/m02-fundamentals-of-python/), [visualization](https://github.com/Sampreet/gists/blob/master/tutorials/languages/python-for-physicists/m03-visualizing-data/) and [computing](https://github.com/Sampreet/gists/blob/master/tutorials/languages/python-for-physicists/m04-scientific-computing/) libraries
